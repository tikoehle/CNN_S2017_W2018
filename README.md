# Stanford CS class CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition
This repository contains my own completed solutions to 2016/2017 and Spring 2018 assignments.

## Assignment 1 - Spring 2017 Solutions
Q1: k-Nearest Neighbor classifier (20 points)
    knn.ipynb 
Q2: Training a Support Vector Machine (25 points)
    svm.ipynb 
Q3: Implement a Softmax classifier (20 points)
    softmax.ipynb 
Q4: Two-Layer Neural Network (25 points)
    two_layer_net.ipynb
Q5: Higher Level Representations: Image Features (10 points)
    features.ipynb
Q6: Cool Bonus: Do something extra! (+10 points)
    Cisco AI Challenge, April 2018: I have implemented a binary classifier to predict service contract renewal rates 
    based on structured business data. I have used a 2-Layer vanilla Neural Network to solve the problem.
    The IPython Notebook classifier_teambeer-model_3_colab.ipynb implements the classifier. 
    It imports the code from neural_net.py.

## Assignment 2 - Spring 2017 except Q5 (PyTorch) - Spring 2018 Solutions
Q1: Fully-connected Neural Network (25 points)
    FullyConnectedNets.ipynb
Q2: Batch Normalization (25 points)
    BatchNormalization.ipynb
Q3: Dropout (10 points)
    Dropout.ipynb
Q4: Convolutional Networks (30 points)
    ConvolutionalNetworks.ipynb
Q5: PyTorch / TensorFlow on CIFAR-10 (10 points)
    PyTorch.ipynb
